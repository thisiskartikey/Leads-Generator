      "description": "Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn't work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we've embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale. Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We're building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same. The Role The Global Payments Partnerships team leads commercialization and business development for Cash App and Afterpay's payments products. Our ambitious team develops go-to-market strategy for our commercial products, builds effective relationships with the largest players in the payments, finance, and technology industries, and drives critical results across the business. We are looking for an experienced partnerships practitioner to source and own relationships with a select list of our biggest and most strategically important partners. This Partner Development Lead will work closely with our executive leadership team to manage and grow existing partnerships that represent the biggest upside opportunities for our business globally. You'll partner directly with leaders at both Afterpay and Cash App across Product, Engineering, Sales, Account Management, Marketing, Finance, Compliance, and Legal. You'll drive a global strategy for your partners and execute on that strategy in conjunction with cross-functional colleagues. You will source and own primary responsibility for the performance of your partners, innovate at the cutting edge of payments, and deliver revenue that will drive growth for our core business. The ideal candidate will have an understanding of the economics of the payments space and deep knowledge of the payments ecosystem. This individual should also have an understanding of what will be needed to properly resource a partner strategy, and work with internal stakeholders to develop a plan for ensuring the success of a partner. A deep sense of ownership, drive, and entrepreneurship is essential. You will: Develop growth strategy: Create and implement an overarching plan and strategy for maximizing the effectiveness of a partnership, in terms of driving profitable business impact and product distribution at scale. Build relationships : Establish strong rapport with partners at every level (executive to working groups, across functions) to influence their decision-making and advance our goals. Design scalable programs : Build and project manager a partnership program that both achieves our goals and meets our partners' objectives, scaling across internal and external teams and across global regions. Commercialize payment products : Lead commercialization of new products by refining and executing our growth partner distribution strategy. Lead end-to-end partner negotiations to deliver maximum distribution of our payments products, including upsell and cross-sell of new products and features.
