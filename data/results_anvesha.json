      "title": "Sr. Product Designer, Provider Experience",
      "company": "Octave",
      "location": "United States (Remote)",
      "description": "About the Company: Octave is a modern behavioral health practice creating a new standard for care delivery that’s both high-quality and accessible. With in-person and virtual clinics in multiple states, the company offers evidence-based individual, couples, and family therapy, while pioneering relationships with payers to make care more affordable through insurance. By raising the bar on how care is delivered and how providers are supported, we are building a sustainable system that values equity, affordability, and effectiveness. About the Role: Octave is a technology-enabled mental healthcare provider with a focus on delivering the highest-quality care possible. This means the tools and systems our providers use become especially critical. As a Senior Product Designer focused on Provider Experience, you will lead design work for the tools clinicians and clinical operations teams use to deliver that care. This includes provider-facing workflows such as onboarding, scheduling and availability, caseload management, documentation, dashboards, quality programs, and other system-of-record style experiences. You will own end-to-end design outcomes for complex, high-impact areas, working closely with Product Management, Engineering, Research, Data, and Clinical stakeholders. Octave operates as a fully remote business, so you will collaborate closely with cross-functional partners while taking ownership of your work, bringing structure to ambiguous problems, and delivering outcomes that are usable, coherent, accessible, and measurable. Responsibilities Include: Own provider-facing product areas from problem framing through shipped, measured outcomes. Translate clinical and operational complexity into clear workflows, information architecture, and interaction patterns. Partner with Product and Engineering to define scope, success metrics, and iteration plans. Facilitate working sessions that drive shared understanding and decision-making. Plan and run research with support from Research, including discovery, concept validation, usability testing, and post-launch feedback loops. Create user flows, prototypes, and high-fidelity designs with clear rationale and decision logs. Provide detailed handoff materials and partner with Engineering during build to ensure design quality through launch. Use and extend the design system to raise quality and consistency across surfaces. Collaborate with Brand/Creative to ensure provider tools maintain Octave’s brand aesthetic and standards, while prioritizing clarity, trust, and clinical usability. Mentor other designers through critique, pairing, and practical guidance; contribute to team norms and craft standards. Qualifications: 5+ years of professional product design experience for web and/or mobile. Experience designing for medical providers, healthcare organizations, or other regulated industries is a plus, including experience with one or more of the following: Provider apps or portals Clinical dashboards or care team tools Scheduling and availability systems Documentation workflows (notes, forms, assessments) Full EHRs or EHR-adjacent tools Familiarity with healthcare privacy and compliance constraints (PHI, HIPAA) and how they shape product design. Track record of shipping end-to-end product work with measurable outcomes. Experience operating as a senior-level IC: independently driving projects, influencing scope, and raising quality across partners. Experience partnering closely with clinical operations teams and supporting operational change with product design. Some experience in service design or systems thinking. Strong interaction design fundamentals, including workflows, states, edge cases, and constraints. Proven ability to design complex internal or provider tools, such as dashboards, scheduling, and documentation workflows, a plus. Comfort working with domain experts (clinical leaders, care ops, compliance) and converting input into actionable product decisions. High proficiency in Figma (or similar) for designing, prototyping, and maintaining component-based UI; familiarity with AI-assisted prototyping practices that speed exploration and iteration while respecting privacy and quality standards. Working knowledge of user research methods and when to apply them. Strong written and verbal communication, including async documentation, executive-ready storytelling to build buy-in, and decision-making in distributed teams. Comfort working fully remote in a distributed company; consistent follow-through without heavy day-to-day oversight. Ability to use data and qualitative feedback together to guide iteration and measure impact. Practical understanding of accessibility expectations for digital products. Demonstrated ability and experience working in a startup or fast-paced work environment. Octave's Company Values: The below values drive our day-to-day operations. We’re human beings first. We operate with empathy and kindness – with our clients, with our collaborators, and with ourselves. People deserve better than status quo. We’re willing to tackle the intractable problems, no matter how big, because someone should. We ask big questions, we craft big solutions, and we challenge ourselves and others to make it happen. No bystanders. No stars. No tourists. Each person has been selected to be here, and with that comes a responsibility to bring your expertise, share your ideas, and help make this company better. Partnership paves the path ahead. We don’t operate in a silo, internally or externally. To transform the system, we believe in working with others to create something bigger, better, and stronger. Quality is crucial at scale. Quality is core to our business, and we refuse to sacrifice it as we grow. Progress is a process. In the pursuit of progress, we iterate, reflect, learn, adjust – and always leave things better than we found them. There are people behind every data point. We recognize that numbers tell only one part of the story, and we also do the work to understand impacts at the individual level.

Must be able to frequently communicate with others through virtual meeting applications such as Zoom and Google Meet. Must be able to observe and communicate information on company provided laptop.

However, employees who have access to the compensation information of other employees or applicants as a part of their essential job functions cannot disclose the pay of other employees or applicants to individuals who do not otherwise have access to compensation information, unless the disclosure is (a) in response to a formal complaint or charge, (b) in furtherance of an investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action, including an investigation conducted by the employer, or (c) consistent with Octave’s legal duty to furnish information. Starting pay for qualified applicants will depend on a combination of job-related factors, which may include education, training, experience, location, business needs, or market demands.
