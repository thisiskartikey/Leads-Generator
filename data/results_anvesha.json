      "description": "What we do: Halcyon is the industry’s first dedicated, adaptive security platform that combines multiple proprietary advanced prevention engines along with AI models focused specifically on stopping ransomware. Who we are: Halcyon was formed in 2021 by a team of cyber industry veterans after battling the scourge of ransomware (and advanced threats) for years at some of the largest global security vendors. Comprised of leaders from Cylance (now Blackberry), Accuvant (now Optiv), Fireye and ISS X-Force (now IBM), Halcyon is focused on building products and solutions for mid-market and enterprise customers. As a remote-native, completely distributed global team, we recognize great talent can exist anywhere. We invite you to apply to a job you’re interested in and we'll work a plan to meet your needs. The Role Halcyon’s mission is to deliver an anti-ransomware platform that redefines what modern security products can achieve. As our Principal Product UX Designer , you will lead and evolve the end-to-end user experience of the Halcyon platform—from core console workflows and policy management to alert triage, data visualization, and third-party integrations. This is a highly influential role with broad product impact. As Halcyon’s most senior UX practitioner, you will set the UX direction, advance design standards, and continuously raise the quality and usability of a growing, enterprise-grade platform. You’ll partner closely with Product, Engineering, Threat Response, Quant, and Customer Success teams to translate complex security data into intuitive, actionable, and visually compelling experiences that help customers stop ransomware in its tracks. Responsibilities Design Leadership & Strategy: Define and champion Halcyon’s UX vision, principles, and long-term design strategy across the platform. Enable and elevate the UX design team to actively participate in shaping product direction and executive decision-making, ensuring decisions are grounded in shared user-centered insights, research, and data. User-Centered Design: Lead user research efforts including discovery interviews, persona development, journey mapping, and usability testing. Synthesize qualitative and quantitative insights into clear, actionable product and design recommendations. Product & Feature Design: Drive end-to-end design for complex enterprise workflows, from concept through shipped UI. Rapidly iterate on user flows, wireframes, prototypes, and high-fidelity designs in close collaboration with Product, Engineering, and stakeholders. Balance user needs, technical constraints, and business priorities to deliver pragmatic, high-impact solutions. Design System Ownership: Evolve and govern Halcyon’s design system in Figma, including components, patterns, tokens, and interaction standards. Ensure visual and interaction consistency across the web application, documentation, and in-product messaging. Partner closely with engineering to ensure scalable, high-quality implementation. Data Visualization & Complex Interfaces: Translate dense telemetry—alerts, events, timelines, and security signals—into clear, actionable dashboards and visualizations. Design interfaces that accelerate comprehension, investigation, and response for security teams operating under pressure. Cross-Functional Collaboration: Work closely with PMs, engineers, security analysts, brand, and marketing to deliver accessible, high-quality experiences. Clearly communicate and defend design decisions using user data, usability findings, and industry best practices. Continuous Improvement: Analyze user behavior and product usage to identify opportunities to improve usability, efficiency, and clarity. Iterate in a fast-paced environment, incorporating customer feedback and evolving technical realities into design solutions. Skills & Qualifications 8–12+ years of experience in Product UX/UI design for Enterprise SaaS or complex software platforms (cybersecurity, observability, or data-intensive tools strongly preferred). Portfolio demonstrating end-to-end product design ownership—from research and strategy through execution and shipped experiences. Deep experience with low- and high-fidelity design tools, rapid prototyping, and design-system management (Figma required). Proven ability to design for complex enterprise workflows, including RBAC, dashboards, policy engines, APIs, and multi-tenant systems. Strong understanding of modern front-end patterns and technical constraints. Familiarity with React, Material UI, or similar frameworks to collaborate effectively with engineers. Experience designing security, observability, or analytics dashboards (alerts, events, detections, timelines, MITRE ATT&CK, assets, users, policies). Exceptional communication and storytelling skills, with the ability to influence stakeholders at all levels. Thrives in high-growth, evolving environments; self-directed, decisive, and action-oriented. Why Halcyon Mission-critical impact: Your work directly helps global enterprises prevent and recover from ransomware attacks.
