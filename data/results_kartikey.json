      "description": "Who we are About Stripe Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career. About the team Developers increasingly want to extend and customize Stripe. Today, using Stripe Apps, developers can build experiences that embed a custom UI within the Stripe Dashboard, call the Stripe API to create and modify Stripe data, bidirectionally sync data between Stripe and 3rd-party services, and more. In the future, Stripe Apps will be able to package multiple new extensions that Stripe is releasing over the next few years. For example, Stripe Apps will be central to the product experience of how users build and deploy Scripts, a new extensibility primitive that allows users to run arbitrary TypeScript on Stripe in an isolated execution environment. This role is responsible for Stripe Apps as the core platform for Stripe’s extensibility product experience. You’ll be working on problems, such as; improving the end-to-end developer experience of building and releasing Stripe Apps, defining how developers should debug and fix extension runtime errors, defining how extensions should be packaged and versioned within Stripe Apps, and more. You’ll work very closely with users and third-party developers to understand their needs and translate them into platform capabilities. You’ll also partner closely with the Stripe Apps GTM and Partnerships teams to build new functionality that enables developers to bring their visions to market. What you’ll do You will be responsible for product management of the core platform that powers Stripe Apps and Extensions. You'll deliver platform features that enable app developers to better serve the needs of Stripe users. You’ll deliver platform features that make it easy for users to build, deploy, and observe extensions. You’ll also work very closely with the Stripe Apps GTM and Partnerships teams to build new functionality that unlocks new opportunities. Responsibilities Interact with users, app developers, and internal product teams daily, to validate product ideas/requirements and prototypes Partner with engineering and design to ship functionality that delights users and app developers, has the right balance of impact vs engineering cost, and makes a measurable impact Develop the vision, strategy, and roadmap, for Stripe Apps and the core extensibility platform Define key success metrics Work closely with user researchers to test hypotheses and understand user pain points Who you are We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement. Minimum requirements 12+ years of Product Management experience Computer Science background or equivalent technical experience Both a passion for and experience with building and shipping application platforms for developers. For example, you’ve shipped an app platform, or have deep experience with app platforms as an app developer. Strong written and verbal communication skills, structuring ambiguous concepts clearly and from first principles Thrive in a collaborative environment involving different functions, stakeholders, and subject matter experts Demonstrated experience of leading initiatives across large engineering organizations, spanning multiple cross-functional teams to influence tech roadmap planning and execution Preferred qualifications You enjoy using social media to interact directly with customers for feedback You’ve founded a business / startup, taking a product from 0-1 Your hands are filthy. You only ship functionality after you’ve personally test driven it and made heavy edits to the documentation. This role is available either in an office or a remote location (35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office). Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams. A remote location is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently live or plan to live. The annual US base salary range for this role is $214,300 - $321,500. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process. Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends. Office locations South San Francisco HQ, New York, or Seattle Remote locations Remote in United States Team Platform Job type Full time Apply for this role At Stripe, we're looking for people with passion, grit, and integrity. You're encouraged to apply even if your experience doesn't precisely match the job description. Your skills and passion will stand out—and set you apart—especially if your career has taken some extraordinary twists and turns. At Stripe, we welcome diverse perspectives and people who think rigorously and aren't afraid to challenge assumptions. Join us.",
