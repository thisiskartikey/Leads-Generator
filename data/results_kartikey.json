We use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to help make our hiring process efficient, fair, and transparent, but automation never makes the final call. Every hiring decision is made by real Twilions, ensuring a human touch at every step. . See yourself at Twilio Join us as a Principal Product Manager on the Console & API team, leading product development for Console Copilot backend services and AI agent platforms. About the job This position is a high-leverage leadership role designed to drive the strategy and execution of Twilio’s Copilot Backend Services. You will build the foundational AI orchestration engines that power Twilio’s own intelligent agents—the virtual experts that serve our customers across the Twilio Console and various support channels. As a Principal PM, you will define how our backend services ingest vast amounts of Twilio-specific product knowledge, documentation, and real-time telemetry to provide proactive \"nudges\" and conversational assistance. Your goal is to move beyond static help docs to a world where our backend predicts customer friction and solves it autonomously. You will ensure these agents are performant, context-aware, and seamlessly integrated into the customer’s journey from sign-up to global scale. Responsibilities In this role, you’ll: Design the \"Twilio Brain\": Lead the strategy for backend services that aggregate Twilio’s proprietary data (docs, support tickets, API logs) into a unified knowledge layer for our internal agents. Drive Proactive Engagement: Define the logic and triggers for AI \"nudges\"—real-time, backend-driven interventions that guide customers when they encounter errors or configuration hurdles. Omnichannel Agent Orchestration: Ensure the Copilot backend provides a consistent \"memory\" and personality for agents, whether the customer is interacting via the Console, SMS, or Slack. Optimize Agent Accuracy: Establish the frameworks for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and fine-tuning to ensure the Copilot provides technically accurate, \"hallucination-free\" advice on Twilio’s complex product suite. Cross-Functional Integration: Partner with Product, Engineering, and Growth teams to embed intelligent assistance directly into the core user flows of every Twilio product. Performance & Reliability: Manage the infrastructure costs and latency of LLM calls to ensure that Twilio’s agents respond in real-time without compromising the snappiness of the Console. Qualifications Twilio values diverse experiences from all kinds of industries, and we encourage everyone who meets the required qualifications to apply. If your career is just starting or hasn't followed a traditional path, don't let that stop you from considering Twilio. We are always looking for people who will bring something new to the table! *Required: Extensive Experience: 8+ years of Product Management experience, with a focus on backend services, internal platforms, or intelligent automation. Contextual AI Expertise: Deep understanding of how to build AI systems that utilize contextual data (user state, account history, real-time logs) to provide relevant, personalized assistance. Experience with RAG & Tooling: Familiarity with building RAG pipelines and giving agents \"tools\" (e.g., the ability to look up a customer's recent SID errors or billing status) to solve problems. Growth-Oriented Mindset: Proven ability to use AI to drive business metrics like time-to-first-hello, churn reduction, and support ticket deflection. Technical Acumen: Ability to design backend systems that can handle high-concurrency AI interactions while maintaining strict data privacy and security. Storytelling & Influence: Experience convincing product teams to integrate centralized AI services into their specific product silos. Desired: Conversational UX for Tech: Experience building chatbots or assistants specifically for technical/developer personas (e.g., GitHub Copilot, AWS Q). Behavioral Analytics: Experience using data to identify \"friction points\" in a user journey and designing automated interventions to solve them. Multi-Modal Experience: Knowledge of how to transition a customer conversation from a web-based chat to a live support ticket or a phone call with full context.
